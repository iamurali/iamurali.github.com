            "content": "Rails with postgresql views by leveraging active record entity models . Problem Statement . We had a use case where we had to generate a report in an existing meeting scheduler system. This report shows all the data of report around meeting. . While showing the report it involes the most complex logic based on role, meetings, meeting attendees, meeting customer information, meeting notes that being captrued. There are around 20+ filters present around the reports. . We had to expose an endpoint which gives back information in a format of attendee and respective meeting. It could be csv, excel or any other format. . . Lets try heavy lifting in ruby . Initial Existing implementaiton we had implemented in ruby. The naive approach will include initialize each object and assoicated objects to the meeting. . This worked well initally for small amount of data. It started giving performance problems when there are more than 2K meetings and each meeting has approximately 10. Which eventually become 21K objects initialization and storing the data in-memory while processing all of them. . Benchmark.bm { |x| x.report { MeetingRequest.all.each do |meeting_request| meeting_request_details = meeting_request.meeting_meta_reports_on_demand(mm_role_uuid, [], &#39; || &#39;, {template_mode: &quot;separated&quot;}) end } } # user system total real # 444.780000 12.660000 457.440000 (780.303877) # =&gt; [#&lt;Benchmark::Tms:0x000000001ba8cc88 @label=&quot;&quot;, @real=780.3038765005767, @cstime=0.0, @cutime=0.0, @stime=12.66, @utime=444.78000000000003, @total=457.44000000000005&gt;] . It takes 10 seconds to retrieve the data and to format it. In a real life scenario, we would have to account for the time needed for the request to go through all the stack, from routing to rendering the views. 10 seconds is a lot of time, specially if you have lots of requests coming. . It started taking more than 60 seconds if the request is having heavy data to manipulate and request. . Working with postgres views .                 Database view is named query that provides another way to present data in the database tables. A view is defined based on one or more tables which are known as base tables. When you create a view, you basically create a query and assign it a name, therefore a view is useful for wrapping a commonly used complex query. . Postgres has different types of views which are present. . Logical Views | Materialized views | . Logical Views .                 They evaluate the data in the tables underlying the view definition at the time the view is queried. It is a logical view of your tables, with no data stored anywhere else. .                 The upside of a view is that it will always return the latest data to you. The downside of a view is that its performance depends on how good a select statement the view is based on. If the select statement used by the view joins many tables, or uses joins based on non-indexed columns, the view could perform poorly. . Materialized Views . They are similar to regular views, in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement), however, the underlying query result set has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view, you are querying a table, which may also be indexed. (source) . Benchmark.bm { |x| x.report { meetings, te, tp, cp, pr = MeetingView.all.sort_and_grouping({}.merge({current_location: location})) settings = MeetingViewUtils::Settings.get_options(meetings, {}.merge({current_location: location}));0 meeting_objs = MeetingViewUtils::MergedMeetingViewSerializer.new(meetings, settings, current_event).ondemand_attribs } } # user system total real # 0.220000 0.000000 0.220000 ( 3.059728) # =&gt; [#&lt;Benchmark::Tms:0x000000002de13138 @label=&quot;&quot;, @real=3.059727756306529, @cstime=0.0, @cutime=0.0, @stime=0.0, @utime=0.22000000000002728, @total=0.22000000000002728&gt;] .",

            "title": "Template Rendering with Dynamic context",
            "content": "Template Rendering with Dynamic context . Problem Statement . In one of projects when we had to build a service to generate history for a particular entity if there are changes occurs. we had to build a template engine which can translate the entity changes in humar redable format. . Formatting text as YAML: . entity: Event - changes: from: 2020-08-15 to: 2020-08-17 - expected_format: &quot;Event rescheduled event from Aug 15th to Augh 17th by bob (Current User)&quot; . Solution: . We have utilized the concept of Binding class able to encapsulate execution context of the receiver object. . For simplicity we chose ERB, we can place them within locale files for internationalisation and can be edit them with ease if need arises. . Since we extend OpenStruct we can simply pass a hash to it during instantiation and all the keys will be accessible as methods and will be exposed directly during rendering. . require &#39;erb&#39; require &#39;ostruct&#39; include ERB::Util module AuditMessage class ErbTemplate &lt; OpenStruct def render(template) ERB.new(template).result(binding) end def current_user # ===&gt; Fetch current user user_id, user_type = self[:_audit].user_id, self[:_audit].user_type user_type.classify.constantize.find(user_id) rescue self[:user] end def system_user OpenStruct.new(name: &quot;System User&quot;) end def get_old_value(field) # ===&gt; Try to fetch the old value from the audit # {&quot;field&quot;: [&quot;old_value&quot;, &quot;new_value&quot;]} get_value(self[field]) end def get_new_value(field) # ===&gt; Try to fetch the old value from the audit # {&quot;field&quot;: [&quot;old_value&quot;, &quot;new_value&quot;]} get_value(self[field], &quot;new_value&quot;) end def method_missing(method, *args, &amp;block) respond_to?(method) ? self[method] : self[:_auditable].send(method, *args) end private def get_value(value, default_data=&quot;old_value&quot;) return if value.nil? return send(value) unless value.is_a?(Array) return default_data == &quot;old_value&quot; ? value.first : value.last end end end . In the above example we have used ERB templating engine for parsing the text that we wanted with binding of current context. . We added extra methods like current_user who has changed the entity. This particular methods can be available through the context which can be used for back trace or additional info to be passed. . entity: event: update: message: &gt;- &lt;%= Event rescheduled event from #{format(old_value)} to #{format(old_value)} by #{current_user.name}&quot; (Current User) %&gt; . If we try to this particular example engine will look for the enity event and update action and generate custom message with the template passed to the parser. It tries to find the methods in the context of the current entity if there are any. . The benefit of creating a separate abstraction is that it creates a sandbox environment for the template processing. This allows us to have more control over what gets exposed during processing and prevents accidental leakages into the context. . The main method here is the render method, where we utilise the ERB library. We create an ERB instance with the supplied template string and then call result, to which we supply the current execution context using the current binding. . The usage would look something like this : . class Event attr_accessor :event_date end vars = { old_value: &quot;2020-08-15&quot;, new_value: &quot;2020-08-17&quot; } template_string = &quot;entity.#{klass_name}.#{_action}.message&quot; AuditMessage::ErbTemplate.new(vars).render(template_string) #===&gt; result: &quot;Event rescheduled event from Aug 15th to Augh 17th by bob (Current User)&quot; .",
