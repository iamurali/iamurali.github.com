# Rails with postgresql views by leveraging active record entity models

## Problem Statement

We had a use case where we had to generate a report in an existing meeting scheduler system. This report shows all the data of report around meeting. 

While showing the report it involes the most complex logic based on role, meetings, meeting attendees, meeting customer information, meeting notes that being captrued. There are around 20+ filters present around the reports. 

We had to expose an endpoint which gives back information in a format of attendee and respective meeting. It could be csv, excel or any other format.

## Lets try heavy lifting in ruby

Initial Existing implementaiton we had implemented in ruby. The naive approach will include initialize each object and assoicated objects to the meeting. 

This worked well initally for small amount of data. It started giving performance problems when there are more than 2K meetings and each meeting has approximately 10. Which eventually become 21K objects initialization and storing the data in-memory while processing all of them. 

```ruby
Benchmark.bm { |x| x.report {
  MeetingRequest.all.each do |meeting_request|
    meeting_request_details = meeting_request.meeting_meta_reports_on_demand(mm_role_uuid, [], ' || ', {template_mode: "separated"})
  end
} }
 #      user     system      total        real
 #    444.780000  12.660000 457.440000 (780.303877)
 # => [#<Benchmark::Tms:0x000000001ba8cc88 @label="", @real=780.3038765005767, @cstime=0.0, @cutime=0.0, @stime=12.66, @utime=444.78000000000003, @total=457.44000000000005>]
```

It takes 10 seconds to retrieve the data and to format it. In a real life scenario, we would have to account for the time needed for the request to go through all the stack, from routing to rendering the views. 10 seconds is a lot of time, specially if you have lots of requests coming.

It started taking more than 60 seconds if the request is having heavy data to manipulate and request.

## Working with postgres views


*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Database view is named query that provides another way to present data in the database tables. A view is defined based on one or more tables which are known as base tables. When you create a view, you basically create a query and assign it a name, therefore a view is useful for wrapping a commonly used complex query.*

Postgres has different types of views which are present.
* Logical Views
* Materialized views 


#### Logical Views

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They evaluate the data in the tables underlying the view definition at the time the view is queried. It is a logical view of your tables, with no data stored anywhere else.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upside of a view is that it will always return the latest data to you. The downside of a view is that its performance depends on how good a select statement the view is based on. If the select statement used by the view joins many tables, or uses joins based on non-indexed columns, the view could perform poorly.

#### Materialized Views

They are similar to regular views, in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement), however, the underlying query result set has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view, you are querying a table, which may also be indexed. ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/93539/what-is-the-difference-between-views-and-materialized-views-in-oracle))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that we will have lot of updates at ongoing event and meeting managers expect the reports in real time without any stale data we have decided to go with logical views thatn materialized views.

#### Scenic view

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to go with (scenic gem)[https://github.com/scenic-views/scenic] considering convention for versioning views that keeps migration history consistent and reversible and avoids having to duplicate SQL strings across migrations

* Creating a scenic view

```ruby
 $ rails generate scenic:view meeting
Initializing plugins...
      create  db/views/meetings_v01.sql
      create  db/migrate/20180916125309_create_meetings.rb
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting View can be used as usal active record model and levarage all the functionalities at the same isolate the SQL queries in migration. 

```ruby
# Model
class MeetingView < ApplicationRecord
  self.primary_key = :meeting_uuid, :invite_user_uuid
end
```

```ruby
# [timestamp]_create_meetings.rb
SELECT
  meeting_requests.id AS meeting_id,
  meeting_requests.uuid AS meeting_uuid,
  meeting_requests.meeting_with as meeting_with,
  ...
  ...
  ...
  FROM meeting_requests
LEFT JOIN rooms ON rooms.id = meeting_requests.room_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN topics ON topics.id = meeting_requests.topic_id
    ...
    ...
LEFT OUTER JOIN requestor ON requestor.uuid = meeting_requests.requestor_uuid
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have benchmakred same format of the response format and see a major shift in the time that it takes to prepare the data to export. Please check the below report

```ruby
Benchmark.bm { |x| x.report {
  meetings, te, tp, cp, pr = MeetingView.all.sort_and_grouping({}.merge({current_location: location}))
  settings = MeetingViewUtils::Settings.get_options(meetings, {}.merge({current_location: location}));0
  meeting_objs = MeetingViewUtils::MergedMeetingViewSerializer.new(meetings, settings, current_event).ondemand_attribs
} }

#       user     system      total        real
#    0.220000   0.000000   0.220000 (  3.059728)
# => [#<Benchmark::Tms:0x000000002de13138 @label="", @real=3.059727756306529, @cstime=0.0, @cutime=0.0, @stime=0.0, @utime=0.22000000000002728, @total=0.22000000000002728>]
```

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**We have gone from 780sec to 3secs**

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, DB Views approach is **260 times faster** than the naive ruby approach. If we have proper indexes for tables on what we querying then it will be way more faster. We are in the process of establing the proper indexes and db scans while writing a scenic view so that it can improve lot more.
