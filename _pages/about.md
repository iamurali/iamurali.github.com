Hey there, I'm Murali Kummitha, currently working for Jifflenow as a Principle Software Engineer. I love technology and always follow the advancements in technology, especially in the topic of web apps, Machine Learning. I have a passion for designing and creating things, notably with code. When I'm not coding, I enjoy travelling to himalays. I live in Bangalore.
